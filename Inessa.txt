There's this big concert that goes on all day long at the AT&T Center in the summer.
 It's called The Vans Warped Tour.
 They have all sorts of band from normal singing, scream, and club like music. 
 Everyone who likes bands goes to listen to the music, eat, dance, get free things, and meet their favourite singers.
 When going you must pack sun screen, snacks, water(lots),and a marker. 
 I go every year when they come because it's so fun and a great experience.
