Once there was a boy named Richard. He was a completely normal boy who grew up interested in computers and otherwise nothing intersting happed in his entire life. When he grew up Richard worked for the airforce doing geek stuff. Now he works as a Computer teacher at the S.T.E.M magnet program at Robert E. Lee high school in San Antonio TX.
